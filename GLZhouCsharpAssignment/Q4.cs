        //Whats the purpose of Garbage Collector in .NET?
        //The garbage collector manages the allocation and release of memory for an application. For developers working with managed code, this means that you don't have to write code to perform memory management tasks.
        //Automatic memory management can eliminate common problems, such as forgetting to free an object and causing a memory leak or attempting to access memory for an object that's already been freed
